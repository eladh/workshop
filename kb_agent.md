# AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base Lab

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up an AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base using the AWS Management Console. Follow the steps below to quickly create your Knowledge Base and integrate it with a vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).


### Lab Scenario:

In this lab, we are working with ABC_Corp, which has a document titled `ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf` that outlines their security policies and best practices. Our goal is to create a Knowledge Base (KB) that can provide insights and recommendations on recently created IAM policies within their AWS environment.

#### Scenario Steps:

1. **Access the Security Policy Document:**
   - ABC_Corp has stored their `ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf` document in an S3 bucket, which can be accessed via the following URL:
     [https://abc-corp-knowledge.s3.amazonaws.com/ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf](https://abc-corp-knowledge.s3.amazonaws.com/ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf).

2. **Create a New S3 Bucket:**
   - We will generate a random number to create a unique S3 bucket named `abc_corp_kb_${random_num}` where `${random_num}` is a placeholder for the randomly generated number.

3. **Copy the Security Policy Document:**
   - Once the bucket is created, we will copy the `ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf` from the source URL into this newly created S3 bucket. This step ensures that the document is available within our environment for further processing and analysis.


#### Expected Outcome:
By the end of this lab, you will have successfully created a KB that can automatically provide security insights into IAM policies, ensuring they align with ABC_Corp's security standards. This will help in maintaining a secure and compliant AWS environment for ABC_Corp.


## 1. Go to AWS Bedrock Console
- Search for "Bedrock" in the AWS Management Console search bar and open the Bedrock service.

## 2. Create Knowledge Base
- Open the left-hand side menu and click on "Knowledge Base."

- Select "Create and use a new service role."

## 3. Configure Data Source

- Select the S3 data source

- Input the "Data source name" and select the S3 bucket where you have uploaded ABC_Corp_Security_Policy.pdf file

## 4. Configure Vector Store
- Choose an embeddings model to convert the data that you will provide in the next step, and provide details for a vector data store in which Bedrock can store, manage, and update your embeddings

## 5. Configure Vector Store
- Choose the option "Quick create a new vector store — Recommended." This will set up a vector database in Amazon OpenSearch for your knowledge base (this one is a bit costly , so keep in mind)

## 6. Review and Create
- Review the configuration on the left-hand side steps diagram.

- Click "Create Knowledge Base." It should take a few minutes to create the vector database in Amazon OpenSearch.

## 7. Sync Data Source
- We now need to sync our data sources so relevant information will be returned when querying a Knowledge base.

- Click on "Sync"

## 8. Prep test Knowledge Base
- Once the Knowledge Base is created, look for the "Test knowledge base" box on the right-hand side.
